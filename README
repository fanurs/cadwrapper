PREPARING
=========

PYTHON:

    Install Cython in your virtual environment:

        pip install cython


C++/CADICAL:

    The local directory includes a compiled version of libcadical.a, but if you need to compile your own, it requires the addiction of Position Indipendent Code. To do this, when compiling your own cadical library, do the following.

        ./configure CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"
	make

    The resulting make should have a build directory with 'libcadical.a' which you should copy to this python directory.



INSTALLING
==========

    It should install with a single command:

        python setup.py install

    This will put the module 'cadsolver' in your virtual environment.


USAGE
=====

    The module is called 'cadsolver' so that is the name you should import.

    All work is done by the CSolver class. The only argument required is the location/name of the proof file.

        > mySolver = cadsolver.CSolver("proofs/out.proof")

    If you do not give a proof file, it will not provide a proof, but will still solve.

    Adding the data to solve is done with the addList method, which takes a list of lists. They do NOT need to be null-terminated.

        > mySolver.addList([[1,-2],[2,-3],[-1,3]])

    You may also add literals one at a time and null terminate them. For the above list, you could do the following:

        > mySolver.add(1)
        > mySolver.add(-2)
	> mySolver.add(0)
	> mySolver.add(2)
	> mySolver.add(-3)
	> mySolver.add(0)
	> mySolver.add(-1)
	> mySolver.add(3)
	> mySolver.add(0)

    The 'solve' method returns 10 or 20, if it is Satisfiable or Unsatisfiable

        > mySolver.solve()

    If the solve returned 10, you may get the results with getResults(<max variable>)

        > mySolver.getResults(2)
	> [-1,2]
	> mySolver.getResults(3)
	> [-1,2,3]

    If you need the proof, you can call getProof(). This will both write the proof file, and return a list of lists. The lists will be empty if it is satisfiable.

        > mySolver.getProof()
	> (... file output stuff here)
	> [[-1,3],[2],[1],[]]

    Note that the proofs will end on an empty list due to proofs ending on 0.

    You can retrieve the time taken to solve the set with getTime()

    	> mySolver.getTime()
	> 0.332

    If you have not run a solver yet, it will not return a value.
